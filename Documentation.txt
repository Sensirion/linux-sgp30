sgp30: Industrial IO driver for Sensirion I2C Multi-Pixel Gas Sensors

1. Overview

The sgp30 driver supports the Sensirion SGP30 and SGPC3 multi-pixel gas sensors.

2. Modes of Operation

2.1. Driver Instantiation

The sgp30 driver must be instantiated on the corresponding i2c bus with the
product name (sgp30 or sgpc3) and i2c address (0x58).

Example instantiation of an sgp30 on i2c bus 1 (i2c-1):

    $ echo sgp30 0x58 | sudo tee /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-1/new_device

Using the wrong product name results in an instantiation error. Check dmesg.

2.2. Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) concentrations

* tVOC (in_concentration_voc_input) at ppb precision (1e-9)
* CO2eq (in_concentration_co2_input) at ppm precision (1e-6) -- SGP30 only

2.2.1. IAQ Initialization
Before Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) values can be read, the IAQ mode must be
initialized by writing a non-empty value to out_iaq_init:

    $ echo init > out_iaq_init

After initializing IAQ, at least one IAQ signal must be read out every second
(SGP30) / every two seconds (SGPC3) for the sensor to correctly maintain its
internal baseline:

    SGP30:
    $ watch -n1 cat in_concentration_voc_input

    SGPC3:
    $ watch -n2 cat in_concentration_voc_input

For the first 15s of operation after writing to out_iaq_init, default values are
returned by the sensor.

2.2.2. Pausing and Resuming IAQ

For best performance and faster startup times, the baseline should be saved
once every hour, after 12h of operation. The baseline is restored by writing a
non-empty value to out_iaq_init, followed by writing an unmodified retrieved
baseline value from in_iaq_baseline to out_iaq_baseline.

    Saving the baseline:
    $ baseline=$(cat in_iaq_baseline)

    Restoring the baseline:
    $ echo init > out_iaq_init
    $ echo -n $baseline > out_iaq_baseline

2.3. Gas Concentration Signals

* Ethanol (in_concentration_ethanol_raw)
* H2 (in_concentration_h2_raw) -- SGP30 only

The gas signals in_concentration_ethanol_raw and in_concentration_h2_raw may be
used without prior write to out_iaq_init.

2.4. Humidity Compensation (SGP30)

The SGP30 features an on-chip humidity compensation that requires the
(in-device) environment's absolute humidity.

Set the absolute humidity by writing the absolute humidity concentration (in
mg/m^3) to out_concentration_ah_raw. The absolute humidity is obtained by
converting the relative humidity and temperature. The following units are used:
AH in mg/m^3, RH in percent (0..100), T in degrees Celsius, and exp() being the
base-e exponential function.

                  RH            exp(17.62 * T)
                ----- * 6.112 * --------------
                100.0            243.12 + T
  AH = 216.7 * ------------------------------- * 1000
                        273.15 + T

Writing a value of 0 to out_absolute_humidity disables the humidity
compensation.

2.5. On-chip self test

    $ cat in_selftest

in_selftest returns OK or FAILED.

The self test interferes with IAQ operations. If needed, first save the current
baseline, then restore it after the self test:

    $ baseline=$(cat in_iaq_baseline)
    $ cat in_selftest
    $ echo init > out_iaq_init
    $ echo -n $baseline > out_iaq_baseline

If the sensor's current operating duration is less than 12h the baseline should
not be restored by skipping the last step.

3. Sensor Interface

    $ cat in_feature_set_version

The SGP sensors' minor interface (feature set) version guarantees interface
stability: a sensor with feature set 1.1 works with a driver for feature set 1.0
